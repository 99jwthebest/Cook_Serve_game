## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

**2D UI Cooking Game (Cook Serve Inspired)** is a solo-developed class project built in **Unity using C#**, later refined as a portfolio piece. Inspired by *Cook, Serve, Delicious*, the game focuses on quick decision-making, time management, and ingredient memorization in a fast-paced restaurant environment.

Players receive customer orders, prepare ingredients through a custom UI, and cook them either in **batch mode** or **single-order mode** depending on the complexity. Success depends on managing time efficiently, remembering recipes, and navigating the UI quickly to fulfill as many orders as possible under pressure.

A major technical highlight of the game is the **inventory and recipe management system**, implemented using **lists** and **ScriptableObjects** to represent food items and their ingredients. This approach allowed for modular, data-driven design of recipes, which made UI population, cooking logic, and inventory tracking highly scalable. Players can stock ingredients, monitor usage in real time, and interact with a dynamic UI that reflects cooking progress, available inventory, and timers.

All gameplay systems, UI layout, logic, and data structures were built independently, with special focus on replicating the feel and structure of *Cook, Serve, Delicious* through a clean and responsive interface.
