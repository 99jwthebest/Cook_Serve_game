# ðŸŽ®  2D UI Cooking Game (Cook Serve Inspired)

*Save Titan is a first-person shooter that combines fast-paced combat with parkour-inspired movement. Players can wall-run, slide, mantle, and shoot mid-air, creating fluid, high-mobility gameplay reminiscent of Titanfall. Designed for speed and momentum, every encounter is a test of agility, aim, and split-second decision-making.*

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

**Save Titan** is a solo-developed first-person shooter created as a class project using **Unreal Engine 5 with C++ and Blueprints**. Inspired by the parkour system of *Titanfall*, the game emphasizes fluid movement and fast-paced action in a time trial format. Players must run, wall-run, slide, and mantle their way through a combat courseâ€”defeating enemies and racing against the clock to reach the finish line.

The game features **double jumping**, **wall running**, **sliding**, **mantling**, and **hit-scan-based shooting**, allowing players to chain parkour and gunplay seamlessly. While enemies remain stationary to keep the focus on movement mastery and precision, they do shoot backâ€”adding a layer of pressure and timing to the trial.

All programming, UI, and design were done independently. Basic sound effects were implemented using Unrealâ€™s built-in audio system, and **GitHub** was used for personal version control.

The technical highlight of the project lies in the character controllerâ€”built from scratch to replicate Titanfall-style parkour using **3D math**, **physics calculations**, and **custom movement logic**.
